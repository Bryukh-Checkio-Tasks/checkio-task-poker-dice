   You're at a boardgame convention, but you've gotten yourself in a situation. You registered for two tournaments, but later realized they both take place at the same time. Fortunately for you, you have a robotic double on hand to attend one of the tournaments. Now you just have to program it so it knows how to play the game.
</p>
    
<p>
    The game in question involves rolling 5 poker dice. After a roll you can choose to keep some of the dice and reroll the others. After two rerolls (or less if you want) you must choose which category to place your score in. After all of the categories have been scored, you add everything up to determine your final score.
</p>

<p>
    Poker dice are six-sided dice labeled with various cards. For this task, all the dice are the same and are labeled with the 9 of spades, 10 of hearts, jack of spades, queen of hearts, king of hearts and ace of spades. 
</p>

<p>
    To play the game, you are given a list of your previous rolls and a dictionary containing your current score for each category you've scored in. You must return a list of which dice to keep or a string containing the name of the category to score. If this is your third roll then you must choose a category. If you pick a category you do not qualify for, it is worth 0 points.
</p>

<p>
    To win the tournament (and complete the task) you must score a total of 1000 points across 10 games.
</p>

<p>
    The categories are:<br/>
    <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Category</td><th>Value</th></tr>
        <tr><td>One Pair</td><td>2 (3 for a pair of aces)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Two Pair</td><td>4 (5 with a pair of aces)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Three of a Kind</td><td>6 (8 with 3 aces)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Flush</td><td>15</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Straight</td><td>25</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Full House</td><td>25 (30 with 3 aces)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Four of a Kind</td><td>50 (70 with 4 aces)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Five of a Kind</td><td>200 (250 with 5 aces)</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> 
    A list of lists containing your previous rolls and a dictionary of scored categories. Each die is stored as a string containing the rank and suit as a single character each. ("9S", "TH", "JS", "QH", "KH" and "AS".)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> 
    A list of dice to keep or the name of a category to score. The category names must match those in the tables above except for capitalization.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
checkio(["9S", "9S", "9S", "JS", "QH"], {}) == ["9S", "9S", "9S"]
checkio(["9S", "9S", "9S", "JS", "QH"], {"Four of a Kind":50, "Five of a Kind":250}) == ["9S", "9S", "9S", "JS"]
</pre>
